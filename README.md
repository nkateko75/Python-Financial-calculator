# Investment and Bond Calculator

This is a simple Python script to calculate either the amount of money you will earn on an investment or the amount of money you will need to repay on a bond (home loan). The script provides two main functionalities:
1. **Investment Calculator**: Calculates the future value of an investment based on simple or compound interest.
2. **Bond Calculator**: Calculates the monthly repayment amount for a home loan.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. This script requires Python 3.x. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).


### Running the Script

Upon running the script, you will be prompted to choose between calculating investment returns or bond repayments:
