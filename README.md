# Investment and Bond Calculator

This is a simple Python script to calculate either the amount of money you will earn on an investment or the amount of money you will need to repay on a bond (home loan). The script provides two main functionalities:

2. **Bond Calculator**: Calculates the monthly repayment amount for a home loan.
